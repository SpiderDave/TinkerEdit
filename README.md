# TinkerEdit
by SpiderDave

TinkerEdit is a command-line app to help edit save files.
It can extract files from a .sav file for editing and then rebuild them.
World save files are located in local user data, for example:
    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Tinkerlands\worlds\savegame01\main.sav
It is strongly recommended you backup all your saves periodically.

## Installation
* Extract the files to a folder
* Open a command prompt in the TinkerEdit main folder and run various commands.

## Usage
Check usage.txt for details.
